`FRONTIERER is widely known for their unrelenting, uncompromising brand of sonic punishment, their brand of metal fusing mathcore cacophony with downtuned bludgeoning tones for a progressive metal sound layered with electronics.

Originally a two-person bedroom project created by Scottish guitarist and primary songwriter Pedram Valiani and American vocalist Chad Kapper, the band has since grown to become a fully-fledged touring machine with bassist Iain MacLeod, guitarist Dan Stevenson, and drummer Luke Coursey fleshing out the current lineup. After their debut live performance at UK Tech Metal Festival 2016, FRONTIERER was listed in Rolling Stone Magazineâ€™s Best Metal Albums twice with two subsequent albums in 2016 and 2018 reaching #14 and #17 respectively.

Additionally, the band has made their mark alongside heavyweights in their genre such as Converge and The Dillinger Escape Plan with critical acclaim from Bandcamp Daily's article A History Of Mathcore, citing FRONTIERER as a, "venomous brand of future-punk well worth exploring."

The band has since headlined European tours several times, and has performed at festivals including ArcTanGent, Euroblast, and more.`;
